##Stack
Stacks are based on the concept of LIFO -> Last In, Fast Out
There are similar to an object in a tin such a tin of tenis balls
where you can only access the last one in first


Think of a stack as a back button of an internet browser or a call stack
A common way of implementing a callstack is an arraylist because it's dynamic

Adding for the end (01)
Removing for the end (01)

Stacks are usually represented vertically
Null terminated end for the bottom
